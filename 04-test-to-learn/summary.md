# Summary - Part I: Test-Driven Development

## Chapter 4: Test to Learn

### 4.1 Exploring JavaScript with Unit Tests

#### `learning tests`

> is a great way to document our learning, and they provide a handy reference over issues we have encountered in the past.
>
> unit tests written with the goal of learning.
>
> are not part of production code, they should live in a separated repository.
>
> everyone should keep their own suite of learning tests.
>
> writing the test, including all the surrounding thought process is what we primarily learn from.
>
> use it to explore new browsers or frameworks to see if everything still working fine. It helps to check how your accumulated experience holds up and you might learn immediately something new.

### 4.2 Performance Tests

#### `benchmarking`

> can help guide decisions when there are several viable ways of solving a given problem. By measuring relative performance we can learn patterns that tend to perform better, and keeping benchmarks along with learning tests makes for a powerful personal knowledge bank.
